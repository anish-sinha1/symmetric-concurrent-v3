### Symmetric Concurrent B-Trees

This repository aims to implement symmetric concurrent B-Trees as described in the following two papers:
- https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.5555/324493.324589 (A Symmetric Concurrent B-Tree Algorithm)
- https://www.csd.uoc.gr/~hy460/pdf/p650-lehman.pdf (Efficient Locking for Concurrent Operations on B-Trees)

This repository's structure is influenced by the following repositories:
- https://github.com/postgres/postgres (PostgreSQL)
- https://github.com/cmu-db/bustub (Bustub)


Not done yet but hope to be soon. Status below:

- [x] ioutil
- [x] fs
- [x] page
- [x] concurrency API
- [x] ObjectPtr definition
- [ ] bufmgr
- [ ] index_page
- [ ] LRU + LRU-K buffer replacement policies
